    "### Introduction\n",
    "In 2021, History Colorado (formerly the Colorado Historical Society) digitized and advertised what it described as “membership books” for the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). The KKK is a white supremacist group in the United States that gained particular popularity in the 1920s in Colorado, even being represented by people in prominent elected government positions. While there is no confirmed date connected to ledgers, they are estimated to have been in use between 1920-1930, more specifically between 1924-1926. They seem to mainly focus on the Denver area, though there is also no defined geographic scope."

    "These ledgers were donated to History Colorado in Denver in 1946 by an anonymous donor from the Rocky Mountain News, though to protect privacy records, they were restricted to the public until 1990. Later, History Colorado underwent a digitization process in 2021 to make these ledgers easily accessible to the public. Now, through [History Colorado’s website](https://www.historycolorado.org/kkkledgers), one can access this data in many forms, including PDF images of the original ledgers, an interactive map using the address data from the ledgers, and a spreadsheet index that compiled information from the ledgers. In creating the spreadsheet index, History Colorado used Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, a process they acknowledge has some imperfections despite their extensive checks on the results. The variety of mediums not only helps people access the data through a variety of lenses but also gives those analyzing the data many ways to check data and come to conclusions.\n"

    "It is also important to note the context with which History Colorado digitized and advertised this information. Coinciding with racial reckoning in the United States throughout 2020, History Colorado’s digitization of this data was part of an effort to “actively name and confront systems of inequality.” The emphasis throughout the dataset and the website’s tools and instructions on names and addresses reflects these goals as, rather than erasing Colorado’s racist history, they show the prominence of the KKK in the Denver area. This is also a way to make confronting Colorado’s racist past a personal experience for people, who may potentially use the tools to search for relatives or see the past prominence of the KKK in their area.

    "While it is valuable to confront Colorado’s racist past and history with the KKK, one should approach the data included in History Colorado’s digitized KKK ledgers with caution. While the KKK was certainly a prominent organization in Colorado in the 1920s, the ledgers do not tell the story of this experience, only showing membership without context as to what this membership meant. Not only that, but combining the two ledgers into a single dataset misrepresents the data, inflating numbers and assuming commonalities between data collected for vastly different purposes."
