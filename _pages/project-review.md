  Project review for HIST 4261/5261: Working With Data
---

## Project Proposal
For this analysis, I plan to look at a project that combines environmental data with historic redlining data to analyze disparities within cities. The specific project I plan to look at can be found by [clicking here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/0f58d49c566b486482b3e64e9e5f7ac9). I found this project through the University of Richmond's ["Mapping Inequality"](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining). At first I was planning to analyze and discuss that project, but figured the specific story map was more something more concise to analyze because the project itself has so many facets. 

*NOTE I HAVE A FORMATTING QUESTION!* 
I like to be able to make links open in a new tab. Looking this up, it looks like one way to do this involves adding some code to a file called "mkdocs.yml" but that seems like something we don't automatically have. I figured it probably wasn't worth digging too much into it, but if you have insight about opening in new tabs I would love to know!
